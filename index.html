            <p class="p7">son: "Gotta walk the district."
                Ehrhardt and her opponent, Republican 
                Earnest Leonard, have been pounding the 
                pavement to introduce themselves to 
                voters in a re-drawn District 107, 
                which includes the north em half of Oak 
                Lawn, sections of cen- tral and east 
                Dallas, and a northern swath east of 
                central expressway jutting up to the LBJ 
                Freeway. <br>
                Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse ment of the 
                political action committee of Lesbian/Gay 
                Political Coalition of Dallas. 
                Leonard received the endorse ment of 
                Log Cabin Republicans of Dallas. <br>
                The candidates get-out-the-vote efforts 
                are kicking into high gear for election 
                day. With statistics and maps of every 
                square inch of the district, it seems, 
                Ehrhardt plans to have an army measure. 
                of about 30 "poll pushers" at voting 
                sites handing out pro-Ehrhardt litera- 
                ture, in addition to running a phone bank 
                to remind people to vote and coordinate 
                transportation to the polls <br>
                Ehrhardt said surprise its the most common 
                response she gets when knocking on doors. 
                Most people say they have never met their 
                representa- tive in the Texas Legislature 
                before, a situation which she said she 
                finds frus- trating, given her efforts to 
                get out in the district. <br>
                Gay and lesbian issues will almost certainly 
                be featured in the 1997 legisla- gram tive
                session. The Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of 
                Texas plans to offer several proposals, 
                as well as to fight off expect ed anti-gay bills: <br>
                ▮Hate crimens. Both candidates for District 107 have 
                pledged to support a hate crimes bill, 
                which would stiffen criminal penalties 
                for crimes motivated by religious, 
                racial, or anti-gay preju- dice. Leonard 
                said he generally sup- ports anti-crime 
                measures. Ehrhardt is widely credited 
                with being a leader in last session's 
                attempt to pass a revised hate crimes 
                bill, which narrowly failed in the House. <br>
                ▮Employment Non-Discrimination. 
                Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per 
                Leonard opposes a gay civil rights 
                bill cent voting record for gay issues, 
                and to outlaw job discrimination 
                against cited her assistance during 
                the last ses- gays and lesbians, 
                saying such mea sion and her 
                persistence in lobbying Using jail 
                time for rehabilitation sures inevitably 
                lead to "frivolous law- other 
                legislators to support the hate suits,
                " but he has pledged a policy of</p>
        </div>
        <div class="caj_5">
            <p class="p8">non-discrimination for his own staff. 
                Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill, 
                arguing that employment security is one 
                of the most important social justice 
                questions facing the community. Observers 
                say such a bill has no chance of passing 
                during the Texas Legislature's next 
                session. <br>
                ▮Same-gender marriage. Leonard has said 
                he would vote for a bill ban- ning same-gender 
                marriage in Texas. He said he sees no 
                need to expand the family code to provide 
                state recognition for same-gender unions.
                Ehrhardt opposes the measure, which is 
                expected to be introduced by anti-gay 
                conserva- tives. Analysts expect a 
                marriage bill forbidding same-gender 
                unions to pass during the next 
                legislative session. The question, 
                they say, is how much anti- gay 
                language will be included in the measure <br>
                ▮AIDS funding. Both candidates have said they 
                support increased fund- ing for the AIDS 
                Drug Assistance Program, which provides 
                HIV medica- tions to low-income Texans, 
                although Leonard stipulated that he would 
                need to be convinced that the money was 
                helping people and not "feeding the 
                bureaucracy. Recent pharmaceutical 
                advances, such as the protease inhibitors, 
                have wildly escalated treat- ment costs 
                and lobbyists say an addi- tional $14 
                million will be needed from the state to 
                fully fund the Texas progrm <br>
                Given Ehrhardt's long history of involvement 
                for gay and lesbian issues, many 
                Democratic activists have expressed 
                shock that the Log Cabin Republicans-Dallas 
                have backed Leonard, endorsing the 
                GOP candidate, hosting a fundraiser-reception 
                for him and providing campaign volunteers. <br>
                "They [Log Cabin] really need to examine what 
                their motivations are," said Peter 
                Brooks, co-chair of the LGRI board. 
                "If the Republicans control (the Texas 
                House or Senate], we can kiss 
                goodbye trying to get anything through." <br>
                Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per 
                Leonard opposes a gay civil rights 
                bill cent voting record for gay 
                issues, and to outlaw job discrimination 
                against cited her assistance during the 
                last ses- gays and lesbians, saying such 
                mea sion and her persistence in lobbying 
                Using jail time for rehabilitation sures 
                inevitably lead to "frivolous law- other 
                legislators to support the hate crimes 
                bill</p>
